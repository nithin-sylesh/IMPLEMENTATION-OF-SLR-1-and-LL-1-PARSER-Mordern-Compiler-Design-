# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SLR-1-and-LL-1-PARSER-Mordern-Compiler-Design-
The LL(1) ,SLR(1) parser is a useful formal syntax parser.The project includes the implementation of LL(1) SLR(1) and , two of the most essential principles in compiler design.This Paper demonstrates how one of the key abstract principles taught in a compiler development course may be applied.Compiler is the heart of the programming language so the therefore if we enhance the compilers; we make the execution more efficient.In this paper we present the SLR and LL(1) Parser model which is the major stage of the compiler phases as it is responsible for grammatical inspection of program statements and takes longer than the other stages
